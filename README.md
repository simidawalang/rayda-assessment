# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Cloning Repo
In your desired directory on your machine, run:
### `git clone https://github.com/simidawalang/rayda-assessment.git`

## Installing Dependencies
I used yarn as the package manager for this project.
After cloning, open the project using a text editor or IDE (e.g. VS Code).
In the root directory, run:
##### `yarn install`

## Running the Application
Once the installation is complete, start the project in the root directory by running:
#### `yarn start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
