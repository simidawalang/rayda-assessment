# Introduction

This project was built using React, TypeScript, Material UI and Redux Toolkit.

## Cloning Repo
In your desired directory on your machine, run:
### `git clone https://github.com/simidawalang/rayda-assessment.git`

## Installing Dependencies
I used yarn as the package manager for this project.
After cloning, open the project using a text editor or IDE (e.g. VS Code).
In the root directory, run:
##### `yarn install`

## Running the Application
Once the installation is complete, you will need to include the API key. 
Create an .env file in the root directory. Within it, put:


#### `REACT_APP_API_KEY=7f02819f-8254-410a-b8af-ab98572bd26b`


You can start the project in the root directory by running:
#### `yarn start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
